- Establish foundational components like **VNets, subnets, and management groups**.  

#### **3.5 Application & Database Services Setup (Architect)**  
- Provision required **compute resources (VMs, App Services, etc.)** and databases (**Azure SQL, Cosmos DB, etc.**).  
- Configure services to ensure compatibility and performance.  

#### **3.6 Secure OCI-Azure Interconnection (Architect)**  
- Establish secure connectivity between OCI and Azure using **VPN, ExpressRoute, or other methods**.  
- Verify network communication and configurations.  

#### **3.7 Data Sharing Request (App/DB Admin)**  
- Coordinate with the **application/database team** to share necessary data for migration.  
- Ensure all required datasets are identified and ready for transfer.  

#### **3.8 Data Migration Execution (Architect)**  
- Plan and execute data transfer from **OCI to Azure** using **Azure Data Migration Service** or other tools.  
- Validate data integrity post-transfer.  

#### **3.9 Application/Database Setup (App/DB Admin)**  
- Set up applications and database servers in Azure.  
- Perform necessary configurations and adjustments.  

#### **3.10 Subnet Connectivity Verification (Architect)**  
- Ensure proper interconnectivity between subnets within Azure.  
- Validate routing, security, and performance settings.  

#### **3.11 Application & Database Testing (Testing Team)**  
- Conduct **functional, performance, and security testing** of migrated applications and databases.  

#### **3.12 Development Environment Setup (Dev Team)**  
- Set up and validate the **development environment** in Azure.  
- Ensure all required tools and resources are available.  

#### **3.13 Test/UAT Environment Setup (Testing Team)**  
- Configure and validate the **test/UAT environment** in Azure.  
- Conduct **User Acceptance Testing (UAT)** and resolve issues.  

#### **3.14 Production Environment Setup (Prod/Testing Team)**
