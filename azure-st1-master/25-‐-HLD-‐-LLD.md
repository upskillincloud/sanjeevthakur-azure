### **5. When to Use**

- **HLD**:
  - During the **initial planning phase** to align stakeholders and define the overall architecture.
  - For **presentations** to non-technical audiences.

- **LLD**:
  - During the **implementation phase** to guide engineers and developers.
  - For **technical documentation** and operational handover.

---

### **Conclusion**
- **HLD** provides a **bird's-eye view** of the cloud solution, focusing on architecture and strategy.
- **LLD** dives into the **technical details**, ensuring the solution is implemented correctly.
- Both are essential for successful cloud projects, with HLD setting the vision and LLD ensuring precise execution.
