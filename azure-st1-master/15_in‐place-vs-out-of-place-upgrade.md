### In-Place vs Out-of-Place Upgrade:

---

#### **In-Place Upgrade**

**Definition:**  
Upgrade is performed directly on the existing resource. The old version is replaced by the new one in the same environment.

**General Pros:**  
- Faster, less resource-intensive  
- No need for new infrastructure  
- Retains existing settings

**General Cons:**  
- Higher risk (difficult rollback)  
- Possible downtime  
- No parallel testing

---

#### **Out-of-Place Upgrade**

**Definition:**  
A new resource/environment is provisioned with the upgraded version. Data/configuration is migrated from the old to the new resource.

**General Pros:**  
- Lower risk (easy rollback)  
- Parallel testing possible  
- Minimal downtime

**General Cons:**  
- Requires extra resources  
- More complex migration

### **Cloud Platform Examples**

---

#### **Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI)**

- **In-Place Example:**  
  - **Database Upgrade:** Using Database Home patching to upgrade an Autonomous Database or DB System in place.
  - **Compute:** Upgrading OS or software directly on a running VM.

- **Out-of-Place Example:**  
  - **Database Upgrade:** Creating a new DB System with the desired version, then migrating data using Data Pump or RMAN.
  - **Compute:** Provisioning a new VM with the latest OS, then migrating applications/data.

---

#### **Azure**

- **In-Place Example:**  
  - **VM OS Upgrade:** Running `az vm update` or using Azure Update Management to upgrade the OS on an existing VM.
  - **SQL Database:** Using in-place upgrade features to move to a newer SQL version within the same logical server.

- **Out-of-Place Example:**  
  - **SQL Database:** Creating a new Azure SQL Database with the desired version, then migrating data using Azure Database Migration Service.
  - **VM:** Deploying a new VM with the latest OS, then moving workloads and data.

---

#### **AWS**

- **In-Place Example:**  
  - **EC2:** Upgrading software or OS directly on an existing EC2 instance.
  - **RDS:** Using the "Modify" option to upgrade the engine version in place.

- **Out-of-Place Example:**  
  - **RDS:** Launching a new RDS instance with the new engine version, then migrating data using snapshot restore or AWS Database Migration Service.
  - **EC2:** Creating a new instance with the desired AMI, then migrating applications/data.

---

#### **GCP (Google Cloud Platform)**

- **In-Place Example:**  
  - **Compute Engine:** Upgrading OS or software directly on a running VM.
  - **Cloud SQL:** Using the in-place upgrade feature to upgrade the database engine.

- **Out-of-Place Example:**  
  - **Cloud SQL:** Creating a new Cloud SQL instance with the new version, then migrating data using export/import or Database Migration Service.
  - **Compute Engine:** Deploying a new VM instance, then migrating workloads.

### **Summary Table**

| Platform | In-Place Example | Out-of-Place Example |
|----------|------------------|---------------------|
| **OCI**  | DB Home patching, OS upgrade on VM | New DB System + Data Pump/RMAN |
| **Azure**| OS upgrade on VM, in-place SQL upgrade | New SQL DB + Migration Service |
| **AWS**  | RDS engine upgrade, OS upgrade on EC2 | New RDS instance + DMS |
| **GCP**  | Cloud SQL in-place upgrade, OS upgrade | New Cloud SQL + DMS |

---

**In summary:**  
- **In-place** upgrades are direct and quick but riskier.
- **Out-of-place** upgrades are safer, support parallel testing, and are preferred for production or critical workloads in all major clouds.
